# Heart-Disease-Predictor

## Overview

The Heart Disease Predictor is an advanced machine learning project designed to assist in the early detection of heart disease. It uses a combination of powerful tools and algorithms, including CatBoost for classification and scikit-learn for data preprocessing and evaluation. This project aims to provide an accurate and user-friendly heart disease prediction tool.

## Features

### 1. CatBoost Classifier

CatBoost is a state-of-the-art gradient boosting algorithm known for its exceptional performance, particularly in handling categorical data. In this project, we harness the strengths of CatBoost to create a robust heart disease classification model.

### 2. Scikit-learn Integration

Scikit-learn is a popular machine learning library that provides essential utilities for data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation. We've seamlessly integrated scikit-learn into our project to ensure that data is processed effectively and that the model's performance is thoroughly assessed.

### 3. Interactive Demo

Our user-friendly web-based demo allows users to input relevant medical information, such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, and more, to receive an instant prediction regarding their risk of heart disease. This makes the project accessible to a wider audience and empowers individuals to take proactive steps for their health.

## Dataset

Our project relies on the [Heart Disease UCI dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains a comprehensive set of attributes related to heart health and has been widely used for predictive modeling tasks.
